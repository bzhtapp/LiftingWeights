1. Which of the following are components in building a machine learning algorithm?

Tried: Training and test data

Answer: 
Asking Right Question
Picking right prediction function

2. Suppose we build a prediction algorithm on a data set and it is 100% accurate on that data set. 
Why might the algorithm not work well if we collect a new data set?

Answer
Our algorithm may be overfitting the training data, predicting both the signal and the noise.

5. 
Suppose that we have created a machine learning algorithm that predicts whether a link will be 
clicked with 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity. The rate the link is clicked is 1/1000 of
visits to a website. If we predict the link will be clicked on a specific visit,
what is the probability it will actually be clicked?

Sensitivity = .99
Specificity = .99

Tried: 99%

Answer: 9%
